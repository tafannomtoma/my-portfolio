            <h3>Pop Goes The Place</h3>

            <p>To play the hide and seek game, have a grown up or older sibling hide the little bunnies around the
                house.
                Then,
                ask your story time kid to find them and tuck them into the big bunny basket. For a pattern game
                variation,
                cut
                color cards out of construction paper, then shuffle them and ask your child to find the bunnies in the
                order
                of
                the color cards!</p>
